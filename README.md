# My-Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio website, to be updated as I learn and grow as a developer. It is where I will showcase my best work, most recent projects, and favorite things to work on.

## Features
* Home: A clean landing page that provides an overview of my abilities.
* About: A section about my background and coding journey.
* Work: A showcase of my past projects, with links to live websites.
* Contact: Contact information, including links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.

## Lessons Learned
* Wireframing before building would have made this much easier. I didn't learn about wireframing until the project was 90% complete, so I did everything the hard way.
* The Flexbox is a great tool. It isn't the solution to every problem though.
* If the source images are all the same size, it is much easier to make them display the same size on the page. 
* Putting a border around every element makes it much easier to visualize how each element on the page interacts with the surrounding element. Just remember to remove it before deployment.
